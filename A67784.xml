            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough this be a time in which it specially concerns all to be studious of Peace, yet it is to be in conjunction with Truth and holy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And it is not without approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed example to write against the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished errours of deceased Authors. For though the Authors be dead, yet by their published works they do yet speak, <hi>Heb. 11.4.</hi> And the more eminent the Author, the greater danger of being ensnared by his errour. I have observed some able
<pb facs="tcp:63898:3"/>and godly Writers to chuse rather to write against the published Errours of the dead than of the living, though the Errours were the same; out of zeal for Peace. But if any in honour to the dead shall think good to vindicate their Name, and therewith what they suppose to be truth; so the Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, I have my end.</p>

               </note> that there are two Churches specifically distinct: So that it seems clear, that the Church was before the Ministry; unless it shall be said, that peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Adam</hi> was Pastor to himself and his Wile. Moreover, were not the Apostles themselves Christians, Believers, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, before they were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Ministers? And may not the same be said of all true Ministers? Ministers regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly should be Christians,<note place="margin">Ames <hi>de Conscient.</hi> l. 4. c. 25.</note> and more; they should be <hi>supra fidelium vulgus,</hi> above the vulgar sort of the Faithful; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <q>The Church is a Society distinct from the Common Wealth: <hi>p.</hi> 3.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Common-wealth, as such, is not a Church: But a Christian Common-wealth as such, is a Church, both name and thing. What in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. is called a <hi>Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The whole Duty of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>p. 43, 44.47.</hi>
               </note> and the <hi>Common-wealth of Israel;</hi> Eph. 2.12. is called the <hi>Church in the Wilderness,</hi> Act. 7.38. The Church, as Militant in this World, is so far from being distinct from the Common-wealth, that rather, as Christ sayes of <hi>John</hi> Baptist, <hi>A Prophet, yea and more than a Prophet;</hi> so the Church is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and more: It is the Common-wealth, as holy, and devoted to God; it is the best and soundest part of the Common-wealth. None so good Neighbours, so good and useful in the Family, so orderly in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63898:4"/>Common-wealth, and serviceable to the State, and Loyal to Sovereign Power, as good and holy Christians and Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>§ 3. <q>None become <hi>Cives,</hi> or Members of the Common-wealth, meerly as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; and they that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Rights of the Common-wealth, may still enjoy the Priviledges of the Church: <hi>p.</hi> 4.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, as such, hath a Soul; and every Soul is to be subject to the higher Powers: <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. And if the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cut one off by Death, as they may; he can enjoy no Church-Priviledges on Earth Or if they shall imprison one, and deny all access to him; the Church may indeed pray for him, and supplicate Authority on is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; but the Church cannot usurp the Sword, or break open the Prison, to administer to him Church-Priviledges. As <hi>Homo</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Animal,</hi> so Church-Membership inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Civil and Political Society as conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in this World.</p>
            <p>§. 4. <q>When the Common-wealth fails, the Church may still subsist. The Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that was a Theocracy, suffered an Intercision during the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity; yet their Church then remained: thô it were greatly wounded, it was not extinct: <hi>p.</hi> 5.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If there be no men,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63898:5"/>there can be no holy men; and no holy men, no Church: And certainly, where are none who difference themselves from Brutes by civil Life on Earth, there are no Men. The Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> ceased not to be a Common-wealth in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Indeed they remained not the same kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth with what they had used to be in their own Land, under Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their own: But they had the <hi>Species</hi> of a true and real Common-wealth, even while they were Captives in <hi>Babylon: Jer.</hi> 29.4, 5, 6, 7. Though the Church be but one, for Kind and Substance she same in all Ages; yet there are divers sorts of Political Government, and forms of Common-wealth Society.</p>
            <p>§. 5. <q>There is one visible Catholick Church: <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If Mr. <hi>C.</hi> do not mean, that there is one Universal visible Church, as distinct from all particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I understand him not: If so he mean, as needs he must, it cannot possibly hold. For the Universal, as distinct from all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals and Particulars, is a meer Notion, as all will grant.<note place="margin">

Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> asserts <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>We cannot tell what the Catholick Church is, but by the holy Scriptures.</hi> Now the Scriptures do not evidence the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church without Faith. As it would be brutish, and contrary to Humanity, to say, that because of some things, common Men and Brutes are one visible universal Society: so it is no less contrary to Faith and Piety, to say, that because of some things, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saints and Hypocrites be one univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal visible Society. There is a greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with respect to Eternal Happiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Saint and an Hypocrite, than there is between a Man and a Brute. And therefore the Title of one of worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Books, is, <hi>A Saint, or a Brute.</hi> Christ, who is the Head of the Catholick Church, being invisible, the Catholick Church, which is his Body, cannot be visible. Christ, as God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16.</note> no man hath seen, nor can see: As meer Man, he is not Christ; as Christ, and sole Head of the Church, he is invisible: We do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63898:6"/>not now see him, but believe; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. and he was belived on when he was in the World, by those who saw his Manhood and bodily Presence; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. and 9.35, 36, 37, 38. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Christ did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse on Earth as a temporal Monarch, whose Kingdom is of this World; but as the Lord from Heaven, whose Kingdom is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by Faith. The Catholick Church is glorious as the Sun at Noon-day; but not to such as are blind, and wilfully shut their eyes, and will not see: But it is glorious to such only as believe, and by supernatural Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination are enabled to discern Spiritual Objects, and the invisible things of God. Some say, this is but a Controversie of meer words among Protestants. They might with as good reason add the word <hi>visible</hi> to all other the Articles of our Faith, and make God himself to be worldly and visible, and Faith to be Sight; and so destroy our whole Faith, and think to excuse the matter with saying, it is only <hi>lis de Nomine.</hi> But Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith are not so to be treated.

            <p>§. 7. <q>There are some things respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church-government, determined by Christ <hi>in genere,</hi> but not <hi>in specie,</hi> but are left to humane determination, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 31.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God hath not <hi>in specie</hi> determined the forms of Civil government, but hath left those under the general Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to humane determination: But though there be a thousand Particulars in Christian conversation, and Church-Order and Unity, left to Christian prudence and discretion, yet is Christian prudence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion it self determined by God, and is not accepted of God unless it be of Faith, for <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith is sin:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> And Faith is supernatural and divine, Christ is the Author and Finisher of it, it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above man and all humane wisdom and authority to make points of Faith. If there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63898:7"/>be any thing <hi>in specie,</hi> respecting the glory of God, and either the being or well-being of the Church, or any the least tittle or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance respecting the Order and Unity of the Church, which is not unchangeably determined by God <hi>in specie,</hi> it will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infer the whole of Faith and Piety to be undertermined by God: For <hi>cadem est ratio partium &amp; totius;</hi> and so it shall be wholly at the courtesie of man, and of sin and Satan in man, whether there shall be a Church or no. All special determination is by Grace, and Grace is supernatural or it it is not Grace, but the same with nature, which is Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and tends to Infidelity.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <q>Each particular Church is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct political Society, consisting of a governing part, and a governed part, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor and People, <hi>p.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This being an universal Affirmative, if it fail in any one instance, that is enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it utterly false. Now 1. The Church Triumphant is a particular Church, it is not the Church universal; for that comprizeth the Church both militant and triumphant: But none will say, that the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is govern'd by a humane Pastor or Bishop. 2. The Church militant and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant do not differ essentially and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically, but only gradually, as an Infant and a grown Man, and not as a Man and a Brute.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63898:7"/>If then there be no humane Pastor in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as an essential part, there can be none on earth to the Church militant. 3. The Church on earth is but a particular Church, it cannot be the universal, because there is the Church triumphant, which is the most noble part, and many of the elect be yet uncalled and unborn, who in time will be added to the Church: So that questionless the present Church on earth is not the whole or universal Church, but only a part. But if this Church on earth be not a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a humane Pastor as the governing part, then of necessity there must be a Pope, and the Popes sentence will hold good against all that be not duly subject to him as head of the Church on earth under Christ:<note place="margin">

All Writers, both Christian and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, distinguish between Oeconomicks and Politicks; See the Title-Page of worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Christian Directory;</hi> but there could be no political Society when there were none but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> Husband and Wife, taking Political in this strict and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary acception as distinct from Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; certainly a Family as such, is not a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor is the Husband as such, Political go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63898:8"/>of his Wife: Yet it is certain <hi>de fide</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> after their Fall were regenerate, and so were a true particular Church, and the first Church on Earth; or else we shall not know where to fix, and be unable to prove our selves a Church, and that God hath any Church in the World.

If Pastor and People make a Church, then Heathens be a Church: For Heathens be People, they are not Brutes; and they have Political Rulers st over them by God, who are a sort of Shepherds and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63898:8"/>Pastors: <hi>Cyrus my Shepherd,</hi> Isa. 44.28. And the Learned know, how that in <hi>Homer Agamemnon</hi> is frequently called <hi>Pastor Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li. David,</hi> as King, was Political Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd over <hi>Israel, Psal.</hi> 78.70, 71, 72. But certainly Heathens are not a Church; for the Church is holy: It is <hi>Coetus Fidelium,</hi> the Company of Believers, and not of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. 7. If the Pastor be Political Head and Governour of the Church, then the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magistrate is not. But it is certain, that the Supream Magistrate is under God political Governour over all the Souls in his Dominion. The contrary Opinion is against the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and tendeth to Sedition. 8. If the Pastor be unregenerate, as but too many are, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly so; then, according to this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there is no Church particular; one Essential is wanting: It being granted by Mr. <hi>Corbet, p.</hi> 6. and proved at large by worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his fifth <hi>Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Right to Sacraments,</hi> that it is only the Regenerate who are the Church <hi>Ʋnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;</hi> Hypocrites are but Church-Members <hi>Equivocally,</hi> having a <hi>name to live, and are dead;</hi> Rev. 3.1. They are but as a wooden Leg, or glass Eyes, or artificial Teeth, or as Tares among the Wheat. <hi>Nihil est verè &amp; formaliter tale cum termino diminuente.</hi> The Church is not to be defined by Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63898:9"/>There is no relying upon terms equivocal in Points fundamental, such as is the Essence and Unity of the Church. He that is no Member of the Church, certainly cannot be Head. An unholy Man may be a valid Minister, and have Authentick and valid Commission to Preach, Baptize, give the Lords Supper; and his Office and Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may Edifie the Church: but himself is unholy; and no unholy Man is a Member of the Church univocally. A dead man is no man. There is many a true Church of God on Earth, whose Pastor is Graceless, and the great grief of his Flock. 9. If the Pastor be the governing Part of the Church particular Essentially, then he is Head of the Church: But the Church can have but one Head. Two Heads to one Body is monstrous, like as two Husbands to one Wife is Adultery. As a subordinate Husband is none at all, but an Adulterer; so a subordinate Head of the Church is plainly none; but a Rebel against Christ, and an Underminer of the Church. Christ gave <hi>some Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.11. <hi>and</hi> 1. 22, 23. <hi>and</hi> 5.23.</note>
               <hi>and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers;</hi> but no Head but himself. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors have an Office and Ministry which none may take on him without due Call; but still they are but Members, Christ is the sole Head. Only his voice is to be heard in the Church, which is a Heavenly School, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63898:9"/>Christ is sole Master, and all be his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Pastors ad well as People; thô it is true that Christ doth guide and govern this School outwardly, while Militant in this World, by the Ministry of Pastors ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. Christ only is sufficient for the whole Office of and Head to the whole Church, and every Member thereof, because he is God and Man,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20. <hi>and</hi> 18.20.</note> graciously present with all his unto the end of the World, to quicken, guide, sanctifie, forgive, comfort, protect, and save his whole Body, and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof; but no meer Man can do the least part hereof: Could he do part, he could consequentially do all; and so Salvation by Christ would be wholly needless. 10. If the Pastor, as such, he an Essential Part of the Church, then when the Pastor dies, the Church dies with him, and is necessarily extinct. But this is evidently false. 11. If the Pastor be an essential Part of the Church Particular, then the Universal and Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church differ Essentially, as Light and Darkness, Godly and Ungodly; and Cod shall be made the Author of two inconsistent and repugnant Churches; and so we make Him the Author of Sin and Confusion. It is before shewed, that all, both Protestants and Papists do vehemently disavow that there are two Churches specificaily distinct: And the worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>second Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63898:10"/>of Right to Sacraments,</hi> hath no less than twenty Arguments to one Point; the last is the unanimous Judgment of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in all Ages, with no contradiction.

               </note> and it will infer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Proceeding, and so no Church at all How this will stand with the confident Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a late Eminent Writer, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that there are two Churches of Christ's Institution unalterably, differing Essentially; the Universal Church headed by Christ alone, and Particular Churches headed by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Pastors, I see not. To me it seems dangerous contradiction; and yet the Author of it is so confident of his own conceit, that he thinks such as deny it to be <hi>tantum non</hi> no Men, extreamly ignorant and mistaken. As it would be dangerous contradiction to say, our Sovereign Lord <hi>Charles</hi> the Second is sole King of all <hi>England,</hi> but the Constable or Maior of <hi>Dover</hi> is King of <hi>Dover;</hi> so it is no less dangerous contradiction to say, <hi>Christ</hi> is sole Head of the whole or Universal Church, but the Pastor of <hi>Dover</hi> is Head of the Church at <hi>Dover.</hi> This is the nature of things similar and homogeneous; that the whole <hi>Species</hi> or kind is in every part or individual: As a drop of Water is as truely Water as the whole Ocean, and one single
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63898:10"/>Man hath as truely the nature of a Man in him as hath all Mankind. And thence it is that the Catholick Church doth rightly hold against <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers, that all Mankind sinned in <hi>Adam. Quando omnes,</hi>

               <hi>ille unus homo fuerunt.</hi> 12. If the Pastor be Political Governour of the Church, then the Church is to be called after the Pastors Name. For, as worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cases,</hi> quest. 57. 1 Cor. 1.2. 2 Cor. 1.1.</note>
               <hi>The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Political is informed and denominated from the governing part, or Head:</hi> And if so, then it cannot be said to be the Church of God at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but the Pastor's Church; not the Church of God at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Church. He who gives the name, gives the thing imported by it. And thus the Church is made a meer worldly and humane thing, and is denyed to be what indeed it is; the Church of God in a heavenly, transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and supernatural sense. Ministers do not Baptize in their own Name,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> but in the Name of Christ. It was not <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor <hi>Luther,</hi> nor any meer Man that was Crucified for us, and that purchased the Church with his own Blood.<note place="margin">Cont. <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi> prope finem.</note>
               <hi>If any where thou find men professing Christianity call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the particular names of Men; know them to be the Synagogue of Antichrist, and not the Church of Christ,</hi> saith St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> 13. Finally, It may not be said, that Christ himself is the governing part of the Church;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63898:11"/>for then he should be a meer Man, and not Christ. To be part, is to be imperfect; but Christ, as such, is not imperfect. As Christ, he is very God, though also Man; but God cannot be part. God is all; the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation makes no addition to God: And tho God be Governour of the Church, yet not in a Worldly and Political, but in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, Divine, and Transcendent Sense: Not as a part and social Cause with Man, and only Mans Equal and Fellow; but as God, in and by Jesus Christ, infinitely above all Equality and Partnership with Man in causing the Church. It is Faith and Godly Sincerity which gives Name and Being to the Church: And this is not partly from God, and partly from Man; but the whole is from God, and the whole is from Man; but in different respects: From God as Sovereign Efficient, from Man as laudably Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Now if Christ be not the Supream and Principal Part, the Pastor who pretends to derive his Commission and Authority from him, and to be but a Deputy, cannot be less Principal, and Subordinate Part; for where is no Principal and Supream Part at all, there can be no Subordinate and Inferiour Part. <hi>Non partim gratia, &amp; partim liberum arbitrium, sed totum quidem hoc, &amp; totum illa; sed ut totum in illo fit, &amp; totum ex illa.

That a particular Church by the Divine Law is to consist of no more than can ordinarily meet together in one place all at once, or by turns, for holy Worship, under the personal Inspection of one or more, as their proper Pastor or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. 2. That where are no Bishops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan, as distinct from Presbyters, there is no Church. 3. That Diocesan Episcopacy un-churcheth all the Parish Churches; or to use Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi>'s own words, <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>Swallows hundreds of Political Churches that are of Christ's Institution.</hi> 4. That Parish-bounds, or which is the same, the bounds of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches outwardly, are not mediately of Divine Institution. 5. That the Supream Civil Power is but an Accident to the Church. 6. That the parts of the Church be similar or dissimilar, more simple or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. 7. That Baptism, as such, entreth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63898:12"/>into the Universal Church only, and not into a particular Church 8. That a man may be inwardly a Member of the Universal Church, and yet of no particular Church outwardly. 9. That a man duly cast out of the Church Particular, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cast out of the Church Universal. 10. That the Ministry is before the Church. 11. That there is one Visible Universal Church. 12. That the first Baptized Person was not Baptiz'd into a pre-existent Church. 13. That the same man may be a Teacher to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, but not a Pastor. 14. That there can be no particular Church without a Church-covenant mutual between the Pastor and each Member, as distinct from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church covenant by which we become Christians. 15. That Councils and Synods are for Concord, but not for Regiment and Authority. 16. That a Christian Nation or Kingdom, as such, is not a Church, or but so equivocally. 17. That it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the People to choose a Minister, but it doth belong to them to choose or consent who shall be their Minister. 18. That the Church is specifically two; a Church which is so materially, but not formally; and a Church which is so both materially and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally: or in other words; that there is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized and unorganized Church: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is a Polity, and the other only a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63898:12"/>19. That a Pastor beareth no relation to Infidels. 20. That there are particular Churches distinct not only from one another, but from the whole or Universal; and scarce any but <hi>Seekers</hi> will deny it. 21. That a Minister of the Gospel is but like the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of a Town, or Maior of a City, who hath no Office out of his own bounds; out of his own Parish he is no Minister. 22. That Ordination is the same with popular Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may therefore be <hi>toties, quoties.</hi> 23. That such as refuse to joyn in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Combinational Church-covenant, or have not joyned in it, though they be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and dwellers in the Parish, may not themselves be admitted to adult particular Church priviledges, nor their Infants to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. 24. That it is equivocal speaking to say, <hi>e. g.</hi> The Catholick Church at <hi>Hippo,</hi> at this or that place. All these, and many more gross Errours, are owing to this one Capital Errour, as their Fountain; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Church by the Divine Law doth consist of two distinct parts Essentially, a guiding and a guided part, as a Political Society. I shall not stand to confute them particularly, or name the Authors of them.

This universal Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly but one, outwardly it is not one but many. So that there is inwardly, mystically, and invisibly but one Church of God, part whereof is triumphant, and part is militant: but outwardly, locally, and visibly there are many distinct particular Churches; distinct I say from one another, but not from the whole or universal.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> A godly Idolater is as very a contradiction and impossible as a loyal Traitor, or a chast Adulteress. There can no one instance be given in all the Scripture of a godly man who did live in the constant practice of the Sin of Idolatry, known or unknown, in any kind or degree. God's Word is plain; Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so living and dying cannot be saved. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. &amp; 22.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. Go a hairs breadth from this Standard, and we make a new Bible. Two things must be fast held, or Divinity is subverted: 1. That it will not stand with true Godliness to live in the ordinary practice of the least known Sin with love and allowance. 2. That it will not stand with true Godliness to live in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice of Idolatry, though unknown. By Idolatry is meant, the Adoration, Love, Delight in, Fear, and Worship of that as God, which is not God; whether it be by the Heart inwardly, or by the Body outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. No degree of Idolatry, no kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry can be in a Godly Man ordinarily, thô not known. The proof lyes on their part which affirm it, which can never be made out from Scripture, and all other proof is too short, it is not proof but falshood. There may be in a Godly Man much unperceived
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63898:15"/>Errour and Superstition, but not Idolatry or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily. All Idolatry is Sin, but all Sin is not Idolatry.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Covetousness known and loved is Idolatry, and Covetousness not known where it reigns and is joined with a course of impenitency is Idolatry; and so indeed is every sin, as joined with unholiness and impenitency Idolatry, and a breach of the first Commandment; and this is the state and case of all the ungodly. But in every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man there is a sincere hatred of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and of all other sin, and a sincere love to God, and where is sincere Love to God and Hatred of Sin, there is no degree of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Sin as in it self is the same, but as it is in the Godly, it is mortified, hated, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and detested sincerely, though but imperfectly: but in all the Ungodly sin is

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no such distincton of Sin materially and formally. There are many actions of wicked men materially good, but for want of holy Principles and Ends they are not adequately good. But there can be nothing truly sinful, but it is adequately sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For <hi>bonum non oritur nisi ex causis inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63898:17"/>malum ex quolibet defectu.</hi> Meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form as such is not sin. But all sin is deformity, and an abuse of matter. To say that sin is a material thing, is to make God the author of it. For every material thing is good for something, is useful and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to some good end, and so God must needs be author of it, because he is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily though freely the author of all good. But sin is not at all good, it is not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any good end, it is no way eligible, it is worse than nothing. Thô God see it good to permit sin, yet it is with sincere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it, and as knowing that no good can possibly come of sin as from it self. Those then who in excuse of the Papists or others make them to be guilty of Idolatry, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or other sin materially but not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do unavoidably lay these Sins at Gods door, by implying that Idolatry, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are material and useful things, and then God must needs be author of them, which is to blaspheme. The utmost that can be made of <hi>Jacobs</hi> fact with <hi>Leah,</hi> and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in those times of having many Wives, is only this, that they finned therein. If this be admitted, it will no way warrant the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, That therefore a man may be godly, and yet live in the ordinary practice of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.

It mattereth not how a man murdered himself, if indeed he be murdered, and was murdered by himself: there is then no hope of his recovery to life, and he must needs be a murderer; whether he murdered himself directly or not, doth not alter the case. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them Papists, and you suppose them to be Idolaters, and if the ordinary practice of Idolatry doth not overturn the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing doth.

But if they act according to their Principles, they do then suppose that after the words of Consecration, the Bread is not Bread, but Jesus Christ himself as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there in Body. And as Christ they adore it. They do not in the Mystery of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantion perform any worship at all to Christ, but they worship the Bread as supposing it to be Christ himself there present in Body. They do not worship Christ as there present in Body; that only did the Apostles at the first Institution, when Christ himself as to his humane Nature was present to their eyes. To worship Christ in his Body is but what all the Saints in Heaven and Earth do; but to imagine a false Christ, and worship that as Christ which really is not, is Idolatry. If the Bread be not Bread, but Christ himself there present in Body, then neither the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists nor we be in Errour, but God only shall be in fault, as imposing the grossest delusion upon men, in obliging us to believe things contrary to common sense. We may and do believe things above sense, but no man can believe things contrary to sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sense is of God. So that if sense as such deceive, it is God, who is the Author of sense, upon whom the deceit must lie: and consequently, if the Papists Opinion should hold true, that the Bread is not Bread, all they gain by it is only this, that in the end
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63898:21"/>God shall not be himself, but an omnipotent Satan and the grand Deceiver of all. But if indeed the Bread be very Bread, as it is infalliby certain that it is; then the Papists by their own confession are guilty of the greatest and vilest Idolatry that ever was. According to their own Principle they make their Maker, and then kill and eat him; they are also makers of Christ as Man, and Man-killers, and Man-eaters. So many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as this Mystery is acted in, there are so many false Christs. And so often as they do this abomination, so often they make and unmake Christ. And such a heap of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Idolatries, Contradictions, Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Impossibilities, and Impieties are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this one piece of darkness, that to be only lukewarm against them is to be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. But if they do not practice according to their Principle, they are then Hypocrites, and stand anathematized by their own <hi>Trent</hi>-Council, which accurseth all those who do not adore with supream Worship what we believe, know, and are sure is Bread: <hi>Qui Sacramentum hoc latriae cultu,</hi>

            <p>§. 13. <q>Our Faith doth not rest simply and finally, but mediately on Christ, as he is our Mediator God-man. Mediation is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63898:21"/>not necessary to the Godhead. Christ's Mediatory Power and Glory as God-man, is different from his natural and essential Power and Glory. And therefore he is worshipped with Divine Worship, not as Mediator, but as God: <hi>p.</hi> 198, 199.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ is Mediator, and as Mediator he is God, though also Man: Yet as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator he is God, and therefore our Faith may and doth rest simply and finally upon him as Mediator. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also in me.</hi> Joh. 14.1. He is not only the Way, but also the Truth, and the Life, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And what may we rest our Faith on, if not upon him who as Mediator is Truth it self, and cannot lie? Christ is the way to Christ, and God is the way to God. Christ as such is <hi>the first and the last, the beginning and the end;</hi> Rev. 22.13. In the Divine Being we may distinguish, 1. The Divine Essence. 2. The three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons. 3. The Divine Will as from Eternity purposed in time to create the World, to permit the Fall; that Christ the second Person in Trinity, shall become Man, and ransome all the Elect by his Blood, and be Head over all things to the Church. Now the two former are simply necessary, and had been for ever though the World had not been: but it was God's free pleasure to make the World, and had he so pleased, we had never been. But supposing the Divine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63898:22"/>Will from Everlasting so and so purposed, the work of Redemption cannot but be, and the Glory of Christ as Mediator is the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Glory of God as truly as is the divine Will of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Either the Mediator as such is God, or he is not: If yea, then Divine Honour must needs be due unto him, as he is Mediator. If not, then Christ is but a meer Man, which is Arrianism and Blasphemy. The Humanity of Christ is not a part of Christ; for that will infer his Deity to be the other part. But the Deity cannot be a part, for then God should be imperfect, and beholding to the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for Perfection, which cannot be. The Humanity makes no addition to the Deity, yet is not Christ Mediator only as God, nor only as Man, but as Christ very God and Man. And I conceive it may truly be said, that the Flesh and Humanity of Christ is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent to the Faith of his People, not as in it self, but as it is the Flesh of him who is very God, and is so apprehended by our Faith. So that it is not the bare hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union as such, nor the exalted Majesty of Christ as such, which renders the Flesh of Christ omnipresent and ubiquitary, but the hypostatical Union as apprehended by Faith to him who so apprehendeth. Christ is the same as in himself, but he is not the same to Infidels and to Believers. To the former
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63898:22"/>he is made a Liar and not Christ through their own Unbelief. To the latter he is very Christ,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10</note> because of their Faith: and there being no parts in Christ, if I may so speak, both <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Christus,</hi> and <hi>totum Christi,</hi> is every where present to the Faith of the godly. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> (as they are called) do soundly acknowledge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zanch.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. de dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid. in. coen. Dom. Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church. <hi>b. 2. c. 35. Hooker</hi>'s Ecclesiast. pol. <hi>b. 5.</hi> Practice of Piety. <hi>p. 11.</hi>
               </note> that if an Infidel should receive the Lord's Supper, it would not be the Lord's Supper to him, nor would Christ's Flesh be really present to him. And the <hi>Calvinists</hi> (as they are called) do hold, that the Flesh of Christ is really and not imaginarily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked of by the Faithful in the Sacrament, and is really present to all their Souls, and is heavenly and spiritual nourishment to them through Faith: which could not be if the Flesh of Christ were not really omnipresent to our Faith; so as it is not to Infidels. But I heartily wish this Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi>'s may die and spread no further, that the Mediator is not to be worshipped with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship as Mediator, and that Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is not necessary to the God-head. For it is consequentially to make the Mediator as such a meer Man, and not God and Man: and it is also to say, It is not necessary that God be the Creator, the Governour, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of all things, the Portion of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Christ Eternally, and the Avenger of all Wickedness; and that the Divine Will be it self Eternally.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:63898:23"/>
            <p> §. 14. <q>I hold it lawful and expedient, that the Elders or Pastors of a particular Church should statedly defer to one that is ablest among them, a guiding power over them, in Ordination and Discipline, and other Church affairs. I hold it not unfit that this person should for distinctions sake have the Title of Bishop given him, thô he be not of an essentially different Order from the rest of the Pastors, but only of a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Degree in the same holy Order. <hi>p.</hi> 135.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do only argue <hi>ex Concessis:</hi> They who grant the Bishop to be a different degree from ordinary Presbyters, and to have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Office as Bishop distinct from that of Presbyters, cannot in reason deny him to be a different Order. For Order requires that each one keep him to his proper Office; and here the word <hi>Degree</hi> hath a special meaning, and is to be construed <hi>secundum subjectam materiam.</hi> The Deacons Office is called a Degree, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. yet all confess this to be a different Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from Presbyters. We are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by School-Divinity and humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry, wherein consisteth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an holy Order, and an holy Degree of men, in the Church. Gods Word, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Faith and Piety, and the evidence of the thing it self, do not suggest any such nice distinction between Order and Degree. As in Heraldry, an Esquire, a Knight, a Baronet,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63898:23"/>an Earl, a Duke be different Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Honour; and as in military Affairs, the Office of a Lieutenant, a Captain, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, a Collonel, be different Degrees, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of trust, ad Orders of men in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; so in the Church the Deacon, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and the Bishop being granted to be three distinct Offices and degrees, I see not how they can be denyed to be three distinct Orders. Finally, if Bishops and Presbyters be truly godly, self-denying, and Ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the Flock, the Church will be in flourishing Condition: but if either be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and much more if both be so, it will be to the damage of the Church. Some may think the way of Church-government as in the Forreign Churches where are no Bishops, to be best: and others may think the way by Bishops to be best. And both these may retain their different Opinions, and live in love and peace. But as for those on one hand which say, No Diocesan Bishops, no Church; and for those on the other hand which say, Where are Diocesan Bishops, there all the Parish-Churches are unchurched and swallowed: both these Principles seem to me to lead to Infidelity. Did such men as <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Latimer, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar,</hi> Martyrs; and <hi>Jewel, Grindal, Abbot, Pilkington, Lake, Morton, Hall, Davenant, Brownrigg, Babington, Ʋsher, Downam,</hi> &amp;c.

But the holy, almighty, and good God sees it good to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and not hinder Sin, in mercy to the Elect and saved, in judgment to the non-elect and damned. If an men may be saved if they will, then the Apostles words are false, <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but of God that sheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.16. And then of necessity one of these three will follow, Either that all shall be alike sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or that all shall be alike damned; or those who are saved shall have ground of glorying in themselves, and not in God; and to say, I thank God for making me a man, but I thank my self and not God for being a holy man. But all these three be desperate and intolerable Doctrine, which no Christian ear can bear to hear. It is then in God's power to save whom and so many as he pleaseth, but it cannot please him to save more or other than such as belong to the election of Grace, for his purpose can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail, and his will is unchangeable.

               <hi>Anim.</hi> The event that never comes to pass is no event, and so is nothing at all, and it would be a repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the divine Will to will nothing. But God as Law-giver may and certainly doth absolutely and simply will the Obedience of his holy and good Law by all. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as hath been said, there is deceit with God, and it cannot be said, This is the Will of God even your Sanctification, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.3. And it would be Sin in us to pray, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> Gods Law is Holy, Just, and Good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. And this is truly the Will of God as manifested for the Rule for Men to walk by. Under this Law all the non-elect both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, and the Elect also before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version are, and not under grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. It is Gods unfeigned will as Law-giver that all Men and Angels eternally be Holy: which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63898:33"/>if they be they shall be happy. It is also Gods will as he is debtour to none, to permit and not prevent the fall of Angels and Man, and being fallen it is his Will to leave the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels without all hope, and so many also of lost Mankind as do not belong to the Election of Grace. But who these are no Man or Angel can declare till the event manifest it. When once we are sincere converts and regenerate, we may thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conclude that we are elected, and shall by Grace persevere and be saved. But while in this world we know not but God may shew mercy to this or that Man,<note place="margin">Hoc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter malos homines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat &amp; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones, quod hominibus etiam valde malis super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, si De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us miserea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatio: Daemonibus autem nulla est in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num servata conversio. <hi>Prosper.</hi> respons. ad artie. falso. <hi>August.</hi> imposit. <hi>l. 2. c. 6.</hi>

Forbear to seek, and there is no hope of you, you are sure to die: seek and wait on God in the use of his means, and who can tell what God may do? perhaps you may live, you can but die. But when once in Hell there is utterly no hope, not because Salvation is a thing in it self impossible, and in Hell men cease to be men and to have no rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Will; but because they are eternally deserted of God, and left to themselves. What before lay hid as a secret in Gods bosom, by the event is made manifest, which is Gods purpose never to convert and save them, the consequence whereof must needs be inevitable despair. Still Gods Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63898:33"/>in full force to those in Hell, Let them be sincerely Holy and they shall be Happy. This is Gods unfeigned will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. But God being above Law, and deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to none, it is lawful for him as he sees good to make holy whom he pleases, and to permit whom he pleaseth by the abuse of their own free-will to be the Authors of their own Sin and Perseverance in Sin eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and thereby to deserve eternal Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. God doth not create men to damn them, nor doth he ordain damnation as the end and sin as a means. But himself is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, himself is the middle, himself is the end in all that he doth and permitteth, in Mercy to all the Elect through Faith of his meer gift in Christ Eternally, and in Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all the Non-elect dying in their Sins, eternally. That it is so is plain, but how it is so is above Men and Angels to find out to perfection.</p>

Where he will find practically, plainly, and powerfully open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how heinous and perillous a sin it is to be unresolved and undetermined for God and a holy life. In both good and evil actions the will is free and unconstrained, but with this difference: In sinful actions man is his own guide and chuser, God so permitting; in good actions the will is sweetly prevented by God, and under God its own guide and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. In sinful actions mans will is both horse and rider; but in good actions mans will is as the Horse, and Grace is as the Rider. Gods government over men is neither Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical nor moral, but divine, transcendent, and superphysical.

               <hi>An.</hi> There can be no such thing as physical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency with God in any of his works <hi>ad extra.</hi> For then he should be a Creature, and that an irrational one, acting not by counsel and freedom, but by natural neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity as the fire burns, and as the Sun moves, by the will of a superiour. God worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. which will is eternally opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in mercy to the elect, and in judgment to the non-elect, and can have no new suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive acts. Nor can there be any such thing as transient actions with God. For in all transition there is necessarily a change, there is a double term <hi>a quo</hi> and <hi>ad quem.</hi> Now if God in creation go from, he goes from himself, because he acteth not save by his will, and his will is himself as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally related to his creatures, in time to be produced by him. So that God in making transition from, leaves himself and his own divine will, and ceases to be constant to himself eternally. And by making transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, that other is supposed independent, and God is made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63898:36"/>upon the creature before the creature hath a being. Go from unity, and we can fix in nothing but infinite proceeding. Though the things effected by God be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, one after another by succession of time, and are not but in time; yet the divine, most holy, wise, omnipotent, and good will of God by which they are effected is but one, the same for ever, admitteth of no new acts, there is nothing afore and after in it but simple eternity. By the same will that God doth will himself he wills us, but with this difference; he wills himself neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, but us freely: himself cannot but be, but had he so pleased we had never been. An infinite agent cannot possibly deny or go out of himself in any thing that he doth. Men and Angels not having blessedness in themselves, go out of themselves by just self-denyal and seek it in God, in whose will they rest and terminate. But God being self-existent and self-sufficient cannot deny or go out of himself, can be beholding and debtour to none. It is but his saying, let it be done, and it is done without any change or new act or extrinsick denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in God.

In the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God are two things, which Faith can well distinguish, but nature cannot. 1. The natural motion of the will, as it is a free and intelligent agent, and unto this God must needs concurr; otherwise the humane will could not subsist, and live, and move, and be in being.

Sin doth not follow the foundation, but rather it is a going from God who is the sole founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith and Hope, and is as a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a foundation framed by mans corrupt and self-deceiving heart.</p>

Gods predetermination is by his will, his will is from everlasting immanent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own breast and bosom eternally, and so must needs be out of the reach of Men and Angels to resist, further than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall permit.

               </note> which are so strong, that sooner may <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> meet together, and Brutes speak, and Trees walk, than a man unregenerate can by all the power within him mortifie sin and make his Conscience holy. He can sooner die and cease to be a man, than cease to be unholy as left to himself. Sin is more connatural to an unholy man as he is unholy, than Reason is essential to him as he is a man. A man may be a man though he want natural wit and reason, as Infants, Lunaticks, Mad-men. But a man unholy while such cannot but sin. His nature is to sin. His nature as he is a man is not sinful, but by the unsearchable dispensation of God he is held so fast in the Chain of his own Iniquity, and in thraldom to sin, that an unregenerate man cannot be holy if he would,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> and a regenerate man cannot be sinless if he would, by that help only which they have,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> and yet the unregenerate man is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably faulty and inexcusable, and the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is faulty and inexcusable, but not damnably. For there is no Condemnation to them which be in Christ. But it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of humiliation. So great is the misery of man upon him, that it must be confessed a more glorious instance of God's power, by the Grace which is in Christ Jesus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem lost and fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> from sin and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63898:40"/>Hell, by sound conversion and perseverance, than to create the World. For certainly the work of Redemption comparatively doth more excel that of Creation, than the glory of the Sun in its full strength at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day doth go beyond that of Torches and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and of the Moon and Stars by night. Creation in it self is glorious, but compared with Redemption, it is not glorious at all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. Creation and permission of the fall as the less perfect goes before Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith in Christ as the more perfect, as Infancy is before Manhood, and as the darkness of the night is before the morning-light, and the first appearance of the Sun is before its full strength and glory at noon-day. As if <hi>Adam</hi> had stood and not sinned he had not needed Redemption, so had it not been for the work of Redemption unsearchably foreseen, and fore-ordained of God from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the World, as the standard and master-piece of all God's works, the World it self had never been. In Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation God of nothing makes us bare men, in new Creation of worse than nothing God makes us more than men, even holy and blessed men. In Creation there is nothing to oppose, nor foregoing sin to deserve the contrary: but in Conversion and new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ there is much foregoing sin to merit damnation, and a Legion of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63898:41"/>Lusts, and the whole Kingdom of Satan in mens Souls, up in arms against redeeming and converting Grace, if it were possible, to hinder the Redemption and Salvation of the Elect themselves. Angels and men are the glory of Creation, but this their glory was defectible, the Angels fell and <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and became inglorious, and all meer created power could not help them. But the glory of Redemption makes advantage of the sin of Angels and men, and as to men, where sin abounded Grace much more abounded, the elect Angels have their confirmation,<note place="margin">Zech. 13.7. Phil. 2.6.</note> and elect men their salvation, by that man who is God's equal and fellow, and this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectible Glory, and remains for ever. If then we cannot of our selves attain to that Glory which is defectible, sure we cannot of our selves attain to that Glory which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectible. If we cannot of our selves do the less glorious, much less can we of our selves do the more glorious. But then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Redemption in its latitude, not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Creation, but as one entire frame, so it contains Creation, and is all in all. For all things are not only by Christ,<note place="margin">Col. 1.16, 17. Rev. 22.13.</note> but for him, he is the first and the last in Divinity, and in all God's works, not barely as God, nor barely as man, but as the second Person in Trinity and so very God, from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty purposed to make the World, to permit
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63898:41"/>the fall, to be incarnate, to redeem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and save all the Elect, to confirm the elect Angels, and to leave all non-elect Angels and men to the freedom of their own will, to perish in the wayes of their own choosing. So that to all the godly their very Beings be in eternal mercy, and nature is supernatural, not as in it self, but as it sloweth from a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural fountain, the love of God in Christ Jesus, and by faith in him is guided and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to supernatural Glory.

More we cannot have than compleat felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ever in Heaven, and less will not suffice. There cannot be infinite proceeding, we must stop somewhere; but where shall we find rest for the Soul save in God? But God is not God if he be not enough
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63898:47"/>for himself and us too. But if there be a sort or degree of Grace beyond what is enough, there is then a sort or degree of Grace beyond God, and so there is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite proceeding. Your Doctrine here is the same with <hi>Pelagius</hi>'s, as may be seen in <hi>August. de haeres. c.</hi> 88. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Writers of those times against <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius;</hi> who held, that we can do Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands more difficultly without Christ, but more easily with him. As a man can go some miles on foot, but he can go more easily on horse-back. But this Doctrine was justly accursed, as contrary to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. For Christ doth not say, you can do more difficultly without me; but <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me you can do nothing. Joh.</hi> 15.5. Go a hairs breadth from this, and we infer the whole of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> and render Christ needless, and worse than none at all, a very Deceiver.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> in his <hi>Humble Endeavour,</hi> p. 27. says, that objective grace without subjective grace is in vain. By the same reason it may be said, that objective certainty without subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive certainty is in vain. And here in his <hi>Remains</hi> he says, <hi>It must be supposed that our faculties are true and sound: othewise the question of the nature of certainty is out of doors, there being no such thing in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63898:50"/>World.</hi> What is this but to say, there is no such thing as certainty objective without subjective? The truth and soundness of the humane faculty is its certainty in the things of God. A sound faculty certain of nothing is a contradiction. Certainty cannot be a thing in the clouds. If no one be certain there is then no certainty at all. If any one be certain, this distinction vanisheth. That one will infer the like certainty of all other who be of the same kind ordinarily.<note place="margin">Baxter<hi>'s Methodus, par.</hi> 1. p. 164.</note>
               <hi>Actus primus (unius cujusque potentiae) est sui ipsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as intima &amp; essentialis perceptio. Vivens vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendo percipit se vivere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Idem actus hic ctiam sibi loco objecti est.</hi> This distinction can have no place in God, in whom there is infinite certainty and oneness. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certain by any thing without him, but all his certainty is by himself, and the infinite perfection of his own self-knowing will, act and object are in him the same divine effence eternally. The finite certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is in Angels and men is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or image of the divine and infinite certainty that is in God; it is two-fold, common, special. Common finite certainty is the certainty which all men have as they are men, by which they are certain with natural certainty that they are men and not brutes. Such as deny this certainty, should not be confuted by arguments, but used as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63898:51"/>brutes. Special certainty is the certainty which only holy men have as they are holy through faith, which is its own evidence and perception in the breast of him that hath it ordinarily: otherwise there will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite proceeding, and so no assurance of faith at all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. and 11.1.</p>
            <p>§. 2. <q>Very high degrees of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty commonly borrow the name of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and the minds of men do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily rest therein. <hi>p.</hi> 78.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This may be true in worldly matters, for these uncertainty may suffice, we can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them; because no man can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living to another hour, or that the day of judgment shall not be this present hour, and put an end to the world. But as. for heavenly and eternal things nothing short of faith can suffice, it being impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to please God without faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. But probability and opinion is not faith. He that resteth in any thing short of faith for life eternal, is an Infidel. As good never a whit as never the better. That which may be may not be; but that which is cannot but be. He that cometh to God must not rest in anxiety, wavering, neutrality, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, uncertainty, and doubtful conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but he must believe that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him. If faith be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63898:51"/>it is not faith, because it is in God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21. Joh. 14.6.</note> who is Truth it self, and cannot lie.

            <p>§. 3. <q>Supernatural certainty presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth two things. 1.

A natural certainty that the supernatural discovery or revelation that is to be the ground of our assent, is from God. <hi>p.</hi> 82.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Natural cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as distinct from and opposite to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruatural, is not certainty, but infidelity and a lie, as making God a liar, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. But natural certainty as duely subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to what is supernatural, is in a large and true sense supernatural and divine. To build supernatural upon natural, is to build light upon darkness, and the foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the building, which is absurdity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Faith doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed suppose us to be men, but as void of faith to be withall unholy men, and to have no reason at all in us antecedently to faith, but what is under the power of Satan, very dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the things of God, and enmity against

            <p>§. 5. <q>Humane testimony as such, is not a ground of strict certainty. But there may go along with it such rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as may make it a ground of strict certainty. <hi>p.</hi> 86.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Bare humane testimony accompanyed with bare rational evidence is sufficient for condemnation, and to leave men without excuse, but is not sufficient for salvation without regeneration: and this is neither humane nor rational, but supernatural, transcendent, and divine.</p>
            <p>§. 6. <q>Every truth is equally impossible to be salfe. <hi>p.</hi> 91.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Nothing is so true as truth it self, and that is God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with whom all men are liars, and the whole Creation less than nothing and vanity. Look as Christ saith, None is good but God; so it may be said none is true but God, that is, infinitely and essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He is more evident than evidence it self.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> If you suppose it possible for one man to be deceived through his senses, it will necessarily follow, that then no man can be certain of any thing by certainty of sense; and if sense be destroyed faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand.

He that can say in truth, <hi>I believe, Lord help thou my unbelief,</hi> is not without some degree of sound belief.

But withall he is under an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of pleasing God, and attaining to true holiness while he resteth in probability. For this is not Faith, and without this he blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes God, and makes him a Liar, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. and cannot please him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8.</p>

               <hi>Baxter</hi> is a sober Protestant, and he says: <hi>As true grounded faith is the Master-grace in the regenerate, and of the greatest use in the Kingdom of Christ: so is a false ungrounded faith the Master-vice in the unregenerate soul, and of greatest use in the Kingdom of Satan.</hi> How he will reconcile this with his other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Minor and Conclusion be not of divine belief, I leave to him. From hence it is plain, that that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to false belief in the breast of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate of his own Salvation, must needs be holy and true belief in the breast of the regenerate of his own Salvation; and this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63898:55"/>holy and true belief of his own Salvation is evidently the Master-grace in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and of greatest use in Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And therefore their Doctrine which denyes the Minor and Conclusion to be of Faith, doth subvert the Master-grace in the Godly, and that which is of greatest use in Christs Kingdom, and consequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all Faith and Piety. And therefore <hi>Luther</hi> had reason to say,<note place="margin">In Gen. <hi>41.</hi>

The Devils and all in Hell believe and tremble, this kind of Faith by which we believe in common with all in Earth and in Hell that there is a God, is in it self good, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. But compared with holy and saving faith it is not faith at all,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3.2.</note> it is not to be named the same day with it. Common belief as distinct from and opposite to holy belief is not belief but a lie, and leads to desperation, if Grace prevent not. But common belief as duly subservient to holy belief is in a large and true sense holy belief and an essential part
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63898:55"/>of it, as none can have holy belief but he must needs holily believe there is a God.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself sayes, <hi>So long as a Christian hath his Graces in lively actien,</hi>

               <hi>so long for the most part he is assured of them. How can you doubt whether you love God in the act of loving?

               </gap> most apparent distinction between him and the hypocrite, saith reverend Mr. <hi>Whately.</hi> Now I appeal to the faith and experience of all the godly touching this. Can there be in a man's breast such a thing as sincere desire in all things to please God, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; and yet he have no spiritual incling, evidence, inward feeling, and perception of it in himself ordinarily? No doubt but doubts may be in a godly man, so also may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. But neither the one nor the other can reign in him ordinarily. Mr. <hi>Corbet, p.</hi> 97. says, <hi>That a person may have some doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a matter, whereof he sees no just cause of doubting.</hi> This I agree to; but withall add, that a godly man cannot allow of such causeless and ungrounded doubts in his Soul. Sin may be in the godly, but no known sin with love and allowance; nor can any sin not known reign in them ordinarily. For a godly man to doubt of his own sincerity and Justification is sin, but it would be a contradiction to say that it reigns in him. Moreover, there is at least in all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sincere desire and longing after the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's favour. But how can a man lust after that which he hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <hi>That assertion of our Divines, [That the true desire of Grace, is from true Grace, and a part of true Grace,] shall stand fast: as founded on Scripture and sound reason, when all Arminianism. shall lye in the dust.</hi> But then I conceive it is true in this sense, naturally sincere desire is not the thing desired, but mystically and theologically it is, this being the nature of Grace still to thirst after more, till we come to a state of perfect rest and satisfaction, admitting of no desires; because where are desires, there is indigency. But in Heaven there is all that heart can wish, no want of any good thing.</p>
            <p>§. 14. <q>The certainty of Salvation is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent enquiry from certainty of being in a state of Grace, and depends on another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, touching the certainty of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If regeneration be not an infallible pledge of perseverance and Salvation, then can there be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Salvation. But all both Papists and Protestants, Arminians and Anti-Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians do unanimously hold, that there may be infallible certainty of ones own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that some have attained to such
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63898:57"/>certainty. Papists and Arminians grant there may be by faith extraordinary, and Protestants hold there may be by faith or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Now from the Principles of both sides it will unavoidably follow, that he who is certain with holy certainty that he is truely godly, must needs be certain of his perseverance ordinarily; and that this is the common priviledge of the godly, and not of some few only. The reason is for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary faith assureth no man of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it is extraordinary, but as it is faith, the same for kind in all godly men, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in degree. If strong and weak faith should differ in kind, they would then differ as light and darkness, as faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and so all faith is subverted. The distinction of objective and subjective cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is before refured. Some, it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, have been certain of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Faith. Now their faith being the very same for kind with the faith of all other godly ones since <hi>Adams</hi> fall, all the godly must needs have the same certainty of Salvation for kind, which any one Saint hath had.</p>

But he who relyeth upon fallible hope for Salvation, relyeth upon man and not upon God, and so is accursed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 7. there can be no purity in him, nor godly peace. Either he hath no hope at all, or his hope is false and vain.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no arguing from meer particulars to an universal in another kind or manner of consideration. All that can be inferred from the alleadged case is only this, That all such as are by Creation sinless and perfectly hoy, may so continue if they will without a Redeemer, and they may not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63898:58"/>continue. But there hath been none crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ance of all such as being by nature Children of wrath and heirs of Hell, by Grace are made the Children of God, and heirs of Heaven, through Faith in Christ. If the perseverance of every one such be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly certain and future, I see not how there can be any such thing as godly hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> or holy secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace. If the case of the Angels and <hi>Adam</hi> prove any thing at all, it proves more than the objecters would have it to prove, and that is, that we may persevere without Christ if we will, which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man will say.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God may do with his own what he pleaseth, but it cannot please him to make void the godly hope of any one Saint in Christ Jesus. There is but one hope, and one faith, as there is but one Lord, and one God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5. Of necessity then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance of all in whom is found sincere faith and hope is infallibly future, or it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said that godly faith and hope are but one.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If so, it was their errour, and carried its confutation along with it in their own breasts.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Not so, but rather the holy fear of apostacy is at once both a sure sign and principal engine of perseverance. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. There is a sweet consistency between Gods unchangeable decree to give perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and mans watchfulness and holy endeavours; and it may and must be said to Saints themselves, Unless ye hold on to the end ye shall perish. Remarkable is that Concession of worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Methodus,</hi> par. 1. p. 41. <hi>Si solum ut aeterni, &amp; immensi actus divini sunt denominandi, lis omnis quae scholas diutius turbavit, de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretis divinis, tribus verbis statim d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That it is so is beyond dispute; but how it

And if it were not unsearchable and past all the wit and power of man to find out to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, we could not believe it. Nothing is matter of divine belief but what is above natural reason and understanding to find out. God is one, unity is his Nature, and he can have but one constant, eternal, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able act. Any more will infer infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Thence it is that regeneration is a sure pledge of election, and if any of the Elect fall away and perish, God is then Yea and Nay, there is no Truth in his Word and Promise, his Oath and Covenant sails, and he must needs be conscious to himself of impotency, and insincerity, in ruling the world by deceit, and failing the hope of his Saints, and yielding up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Angels and Men into the hands of the Idol Chance and Fortune, and so all things to be in confusion eternally.</p>

            <p>§. 1. <q>AS in Sanctification the change is absolute and inherent, so in Justification the change is relative and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63898:60"/>juridical; the former is wrought in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners person, he becomes a new Creature; but this latter is wrought in his state, hè becomes absolved at the bar of Divine Justice. For Justification is a Law-state. Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi>'s Sermon of Justification in the Morning Exercise at <hi>Giles</hi> in the <hi>Fields, May</hi> 1659. <hi>p.</hi> 402.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Justification is not a Law-state but a state of Grace. <hi>The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,</hi> Joh. 1.17. <hi>Ye are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. There is no opposition between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and inherent; but there is as true and real relation between sanctifier and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. as between justifier and justified. As it is true that sanctification is inherent; so it is no less true, that justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is by faith, and faith is inherent. Justification cannot be a thing in the clouds, it must either be by faith in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or no where. It is very fitly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, that a godly man is in a stare of Justification and Sanctification: but to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the same man and his state, and say, his Person is sanctified, but his Person is not justified, but only his state as distinct from his person, this is absurd and untrue. When it is said, <hi>Old things are pass'd away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. This includeth justification and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63898:60"/>with God, no less than sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For unless the old state of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be done away, and a state of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification come in the room thereof, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said, that all old things are done away, and that all things are become new. This stumble in the entrance is no good sign.</p>
            <p>§. 2. <q>The process at Gods bar, in the Justification of a Sinner, will be best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by comparing it with that at mans. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> ib. <hi>p.</hi> 403.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God's justification of a Sinner by faith is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to humane and civil justice, but it is above it, and is therefore its own evidence in the breast of him who hath it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. and is not to be reduced to humane Judicature. Regenerate <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their fall, and righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the same kind of faith, and the same way for substance that we now are. For there is for kind but one holy and saving faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. But there could be no Courts of civil Justice, when there were only <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>

As it is a reward, so it is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a way of righteousness upon none but the godly, who be evangelically wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. The Saints who now be in Heaven are for ever spotless, innocent, and sinless: tho once they were sinners, yet now they are not, but by Grace are made impeccable. At the day of judgment they with the rest of their brethren, being all sinless, shall be solemnly acquitted by the righteous Judge. Yet no Christian man will deliberately say and maintain, that they are nothing behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for their publick solemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal and justification at the great day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world. For though it be their right, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. yet is it not of debt, but of Grace, given them in Christ before the world began, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. compared with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>§. 4. <q>We can never be justified at the bar of God by pleading not guilty. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> ib. <hi>p.</hi> 404.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If indeed we be guilty, pleading not guilty is a lie, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63898:61"/>makes us more guilty at the bar of God. But if we be innocent, we need not plead at all at the bar of God, where innocency it self is Judge. An innocent man may in worldly Judicature plead his own innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and make it out by just evidence to the satisfaction of the Judge and Jury, who are but men, and proceed according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane evidence. But God being omniscient is above all such legal procedings. And therefore if a godly man be charged at the bar of God to be ungodly, this is a false charge, God who is truth, and justice it self, must needs pronounce him innocent as to his falle charge. Sincere godliness is it's own justification against the charge of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, and perfect sinless innocency is its own justification, acquittal, and discharge against the charge of nocency and sin. <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.33. <hi>My righteousness shall answer for me.</hi> At the day of Judgment all the Saints be eternally sinless and impeccable by Grace, not by nature and the deeds of the law.

               </gap> and transcendently glorious. It is pure mercy in opposition to all merit and desert on our part; it is pure justice as it is a just and righteous thing with God to put a difference between the righteous and the wicked. For <hi>shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</hi> God is not only mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisul, but also faithful and just in forgiving sin to the penitent, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. To say that forgiveness of sin, and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith is not of God's meer Grace and mercy in Christ, is to say it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or in part of debt and wages, and so Grace is destroyed.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.4.</note>
               <hi>Eadem est ratio par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium &amp; totius.</hi> If it be in part of debt, it is wholly and altogether so. There is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63898:62"/>no mixture and composition in God. His pardon is pure and absolute pardon, his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is pure justification. As law-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he dispenseth equal things to equal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and so is just towards all; but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Lord of his own will and deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to none, he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
            <p>§. 6. <q>God is more dishonoured by one sin, than honoured by an eternity of obedience. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> p. 407.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though sinless obedience be the debt of Angels and men eternally, and we can no way profit God, but the more we do for him, the more we are beholding to him, for of his own it is that we give him: Yet may it not be said, that God is more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by one sin, than honoured by an eternity of obedience. But rather the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent thief, who upon the Cross repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at his last gasp, and laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promise of mercy in Christ, did thereby more honour God and the riches of his grace, than he had dishonoured God by all his former life of wickedness. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would be dishonour in God freely to pardon sin to such as truly repent, and there could never be any pardon at all, because God can do nothing against his own glory and honour. One sin is but the breach
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63898:63"/>of Gods Law; but an eternity of obedience is abundance of grace, and grace is above law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>§. 7. <q>At the Resurrection of Christ began his state of Exaitation. Mr. <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,</hi> p. 408.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So soon as by death the Soul of Christ was parted from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it was taken into Heaven, and was in a triumphant state. Outwardly and to sense his soul was extinct and gone, but mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically and to the eye of faith it was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from earth to heaven, and was in bliss and felicity, above all the Saints and Angels in Heaven; so that his state of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation to the eye of faith began immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his death and before his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as to his Soul, which was the far more noble part of his manhood.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <q>Neither man nor any meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could satisfie offended Justice. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> p. 407.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by what is said <hi>p.</hi> 406. <hi>A full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction may be made by suffering the whole penalty due.</hi> Certainly they in Hell do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the whole penalty due, and that is, the vengeance of eternal fire, <hi>Jud.</hi> 7. And God is infinitely pleased and satisfied that so they suffer of due desert for their sins.</p>
            <p>§. 9. <q>There is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods threatning and his promise. God cannot but perform his Promise,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63898:63"/>but he may if he please dispense with his Threatning upon honourable terms. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> p. 416. Mr. <hi>Truman</hi>'s Great Propitiation, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is the same truth and fidelity of God in his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as in his Promise. As he cannot but perform promise, so he cannot but perform his threatning truly meant. He doth not perform his promise because he is bound, but because he is God, and cannot deny himself. The sum of all his threatnings is, everlasting damnation to all that be finally impenitent. God cannot while he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but execute this threatning eternally. And he cannot hate and damn a man sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely holy and penitent, while such. If God may dispense with his threatning tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant, there is then no truth in his Word, he is no longer Yea and Amen, but Yea and Nay, and a gap is opened to all impiety. The Law is holy, and just, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. The divine threatning with reference to all the non-elect eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to the elect before Conversion; is a part of this holy, just, and good law. And if God may dispense with, alter, and change what is holy, just, and good, how can it be said that he is not unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, and wicked? The divine threatning is the divine will as manifested in time, to keep our first Parents from sin, to be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63898:64"/>for conversion of the unconverted; and perseverance of the converted. If God can in any wise go from, alter, and change his will, he is then wavering, inconstant, no trust can be put in him, he is not himself eternally.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.18. &amp; 24.35. 1 Pet. 1.25.</note> Not one jot or tittle of Gods Word, Law, and Threatning truly meant can possibly sail. Faith is so far from making void the Law, that with holy zeal the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle professeth it doth establish the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <q>Gods threatning, the soul that sinneth, it shall die, is not executed, nor abrogated, but released, or dispensed with. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> p. 413.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> With world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law-makers there may be a middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween execution and abrogation, because they do not see all things at once, they be imperfect, and act by successive moments and instants, and grow wiser by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and see a necessity of changing their thoughts and purposes. But it cannot be so with God, there is no shadow of change with him. Where his Curse is not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally executed, it is eternally abrogated: where it is not eternally abrogated, it is eternally executed. Where it is executed in part, it is by necessary consequence exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in whole. For there is the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the parts and the whole. From ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting to everlasting the mercy of God is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63898:64"/>on such as fear him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.17. How then can any whit of the Curse lie upon such? Is everlasting mercy, curse, penalty, and suffering? Is <hi>David</hi> now in Heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of the Law, and doth God govern him by threatning? Or is he a loser by any of his sins on earth? Grace hath made advantage of them. For where sin abounded, grace did much more abound, <hi>Pom.</hi> 5.20. Nor is he a loser by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and afflictions on earth. <hi>Quod fuit durum pati meminisse dulce.</hi> Death in it self is evil and penal, but as it is the gate of Heaven and passage to eternal life, it is rather life than death. Some say, this is by accident: But that is a great errour: For it supposeth accidents in God, which all sound Divinity abhorrs. That death is so great a gain to the godly, is neither from it self, nor by accident, but it is from that grace and mercy of God in Christ, which is from everlasting to everlasting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the elect in him, through faith. And if Gods mercy from everlasting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting be an accident; what may we think is substance, and who can prove God to be essentially holy, good, wise, merciful, gracious, powerful; if his goodness from everlasting to everlasting, be but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? It is true on the one hand, that sin is evil, and no man may do evil that grace
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63898:65"/>may abound: it is true on the other hand that God doth permit all the sins of the elect in everlasting mercy to them. In which respect no whit of the divine Curse can lye upon them. And yet consider God as Law-giver, so his wrath lyeth upon the elect themselves while they abide in unbelief.<note place="margin">Joh. 3.36.</note>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. <q>God having created man a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature, capable of moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, by immediate resultancy, his King and Governor. Mr. <hi>Truman</hi>'s great Propitiation, <hi>p.</hi> 4.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There can be no such thing as relation by resultancy with God; but all Gods relation to man is by his own almighty, wise, holy, and good will, which will is from everlasting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting the same, admitting of no new suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive acts. Look what God is in any one instant, that he is eternally, in mercy to all the elect in Christ through faith, which is the gist of God, and in severity to all the non-elect dying in their sins. Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over men is not moral, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; it is not by resultancy, but by faith. Resultancy is a new notion, and serveth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make plain things obscure.</p>
            <p>§. 12. <q>Christs sufferings were not proper solution, a payment of the same; but a satisfaction: a refusable, though valuable consideration: not the <hi>idem,</hi> but the <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem.</hi> Satisfactions are refusable pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63898:65"/>Mr. <hi>Truman</hi>'s Great Propitiation, <hi>p.</hi> 30, 31, 89. Mr. <hi>Grbbons p.</hi> 424, 426.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Solution is all that in rigour can be demanded, compleat satisfaction is no less. If satisfaction be refusable, so and no less is payment. <hi>Idem</hi> and <hi>tantunaem</hi> do but differ in word or circumstance, as a shilling and twelve pence; and not in kind and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as unrefusable and refusable. Christs sufferings were neither payment nor satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in a worldly, legal, and political sense: and they were both in a mystical, heavenly, tranicendent, and evangelical sense. Had God lest all mankind hopeless, as he did the fallen Angels, no man could have complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of wrong: but then God had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himself, and his own heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science would have reproached him eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as inconstant and mutable. For Christ was foreordained from before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21. 2 Tim. 1.9. Eph. 1.4.</note> though not manifest till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall. And <hi>Abel, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and the rest of the elect, were chosen before the world began. This supposed, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Elect by Christ could not but be. Creation and permission of the fall, do but prepare the way for the work of recemption by Christ, as the standard and master-piece of all Gods works eternally. God did not necessitate <hi>Adama</hi> fall, and yet he did omnipotently, freely, and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63898:66"/>permit it; when had he so pleased, he could have prevented it. As it is true on one hand, if man had not fallen, there had needed no Redemption: so it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true on the other hand, had it not been for the Redemption of the world, unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably foreseen and foreordained of God from before the foundation of the world, as the chief and uniting center of all Gods works, and that wherein his Soul hath eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and satisfaction, the world it self had never been. The satisfaction of Christ is no otherwise satisfaction, than as it is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting to everlasting pleasing and delightful to God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and infallibly productive of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Salvation of all the elect through faith in him. And for God in one and the same eternal instant to be both pleased and not pleased, satisfied and not satisfied, is a contradiction, and makes void our whole faith. For what assurance can we have of Gods being sartisfied, if in any one instant he be unsatisfied? He cannot be unsatisfied with himself and his own divine will, nor can he be satisfied by any thing without him; but all his satisfaction is in and from himself eternally, and what satisfaction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and pleasure he hath in any of his works <hi>ad extra,</hi> they are no otherwise sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory and delightful to him, than as they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63898:66"/>are the issues and effects of his own good will and pleasure, which is the same eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>§. 13. <q>It seems harsh to affirm that the confirmation of the Angels, was from Christ as Mediator. It is vertually to say, they should not have had their confirmation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept man had faln, or else, that he should have been sent a Mediator without mans fall. Christ died for all those for whom he was Mediator, or merited any thing. Mr. <hi>Truman.</hi> Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 84, 85.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thô Christ died not for the Sinless Angels, it doth not therefore follow that they have not both their Creation and Confirmation by him. They have their Creation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by the wist of him who is God manifest in the flesh. Though there be three divine Persons, yet is there but one God; and Christ is God, though also Man. But his being man adds nothing to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. He is not Mediator only as God, nor only as Man, but as God and Man, yet so as that the manhood adds no perfection to the Deiry; and it is sound Divinity to say,<note place="margin">Zech. 13.7. Phil. 2.6.</note> that Christ is that Man who is Gods equal and fellow, and consequently is as truly the Creator and Conrirmer of the elect Angels, as are the Father and the Holy Ghost. <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa.</hi> All things are by Christ and for him, and by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63898:67"/>him all things consist, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. If so, of necessity the Angels both Creation and Confirmation must be by and from him. <hi>Adams</hi> fall was not necessitated by God, yet was it infallibly future.</p>
            <p>§. 14. <q>If the Deviss should repent and return, they should not perish, because no satisfaction was made for them. Mr. <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, p.</hi> 220.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is not true, but the truth is this. 1. If the Devils shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sincerely holy and penitent, they shall not perish. 2. But then it is impossible that they should become holy and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penitent, not through any defect in God, and the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, but through themselves, who by their own sin and God's righteous severity for the same have made sincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance impossible to them. If Christ shall say, I know not the Father, he shall be a liar, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.55. If <hi>Cain</hi> now in Hell shall do well, God will accept him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. If God in judgment shall put no difference between the righteous and the wicked, he is not righteous. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. These and the like sayings are absolute truths, and of abfolute necessity in Divinity.</p>
            <p>§. 15. <q>There is in this Justification by Christ, as it were, a twofold Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Justification, and the distinction of these two is so necessary to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent measure of understanding this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63898:67"/>of Justification, and would be so helpful to make us understand it, and speak intelligibly of it, that I desire you would never forget it: passive Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the effect of active, is our right. Against the accusation of being Sinners nothing can be pleaded but only Christ's death. It would be improper to plead faith and repentance. Against the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that we have no part in Christ's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as wanting the conditions of faith, repentance, and new obedience, we must plead our own sincere faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and obedience, or if we have not these we cannot be justified. Mr. <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, p.</hi> 187, 188, 189, 190. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Those words, <hi>as it were,</hi> contain an implication, that really and in truth there is no such distinction. <hi>Hoc est parum ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis dicere: quia sicut</hi> quasi contractus <hi>apud Jurisconsultos non est contractus propriè, sic quasi electio non est electio.</hi> Ames. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synodal. sup. art.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. § 2. 2. If only Christ's death set us free from the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being sinners without faith, then faith is wholly needless: and if faith be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, then the whole Bible, and all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith are made a lie, and all in Earth and in Hell must needs be saved. For do but suppose a man set free by God from the charge of being a sinner, and you
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63898:68"/>suppose him to be an innocent and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less man, and to have no fault in him. He needs no more discharges and justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This one is enough. To suppose the same man set free by the death of Christ from the charge of being a sinner, and yet to have no part in Christ's death, is plain contradiction.

There is no such distinction as passive justification the effect of active. It serves only to make plain things obscure, and that's the least that can be said of it.</p>
            <p>§. 16. <q>If a believer had the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law of works inherent in himself, he were not a sinner, but should be justified by that law. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 419.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The righteousness of the Law of works is only that righteousness which men have before conversion, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in kind from heavenly righteousness. Compared with this it is not righteousness, but unrighteousness, and even as filthy rags. It is abomination to God, as proceeding from self-love and the spirit of bondage, and not from the love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit of Adoption, and as opposite to the Law of Faith.</p>

The first Covenant as distinct from and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the new Covenant by Faith in Christ, is Antichristian, and to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But the first Covenant as duely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to Faith in Christ, is in a large true sense an essential part of the new and second Covenant.</p>
            <p>§. 18. <q>Christ's satisfaction in the very eye of the Law of works is an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionably perfect, and an infinitely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Righteousness. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 419.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Law of works hath no eye by which to see the Righteousness and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ. What eye it hath is bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, and the natural eye perceiveth not supernatural Mysteries, they are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness unto it, <hi>neither can it know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63898:69"/>they are spiritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. The Law of works is that Law which reigns in all the Devils and damned and non-elect eternally, and in all the Elect before Conversion; looking upon Christ through the glass of the Law of works, he seems to them a Deceiver, and as such they persecute and put him to death, and tread him under foot.</p>
            <p>§. 19. <q>Christ's Satisfaction is our legal Righteousness. <hi>Id. p.</hi> 420.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Legal Righteousness is but such Righteousness as all the non-elect have eternally, and all the Elect before Conversion. To make Christ's Satisfaction legal Righteousness is to make him a meer Creature, and not only so, but as <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi> and the rest of the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and ungodly world, a hater of God. For where is only a legal Spirit, and legal Righteousness, there is no sincere love to God. Christ's Satisfaction is in it self Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and ever well-pleasing to God, as well in them that perish, as in them that are saved. But his Satisfaction is not Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to such as want heavenly Faith. To all such Christ and his Satisfaction be a stone of stumbling and rock of offence.</p>
            <p>§. 20. <q>God justifieth in a proper sense as Legislator and Rector, and the Gospel justifieth <hi>qua lex lata,</hi> as it is the Law of Faith. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 421. Mr. <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, p.</hi> 88.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If God do justifie bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63898:69"/>as Law-giver and Governour, then he must needs justifie all in Earth and in Hell. For he is Governour over all, and all be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Law to him to be holy and sincerely obedient to his Commands. God by his Law enjoyns all men to be holy, assuring them that if they be so, they shall be happy. But this by it self makes no man holy. <hi>The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,</hi> Joh. 1.17. If Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be by the Law, it is not then by Grace, and by Faith in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel indeed is a Law to all the non-elect eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and to all the Elect before Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it justifieth none before Conversion and of it self it can never work Conversion in any, without Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 21. <q>Faith justifieth <hi>vi legis latae.</hi> A justified state emergeth actually, as soon as Faith, the Law-title thereunto emergeth as a necessary resultance by vertue of the tenour of the Gospel-law, which only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified vertually, potentially, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally before every believer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but now actually, absolutely, and in particular it justifieth him as a believer when he is so. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 421, 422. The Gospel-law suspends Justification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing. <hi>Ib.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith through the Redemption which is in Christ, neither by the Law, nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Law, but by Gospel grace and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63898:70"/>Righteousness above the Law. 2. There is none of this resultancy in the case, this is only mans dark wisdom set against the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity which is in Christ. 3. Justification by Faith is not a thing in title, but it is a thing in having and fruition. As truly as we have Faith, so truly we are justified, and our Faith hath fast hold of Justification. As it would be absurd to say, a true Believer hath no Faith but in title; so it is no less absurd to say, by believing we have no present real Justification, but only title to it. 4. A Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of every believer in general as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from all the individuals and particulars, is a <hi>Non-cns.</hi> For generals have no exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but in the individuals and particulars. 5. Such as remain in unbelief their Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not suspended, but rather they are condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18.36. 6. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Justification be Justification, then all in Earth and in Hell have Justification. Let them be sincerely holy and penitent, and God will love and save them.</p>
            <p>§. 22. <q>God justifieth in a proper sense as a Judge. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 421. Mr. <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, p.</hi> 107.</q>
               <hi>Anse.</hi> 1. This is repugnant to the fore-going Position, that God doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie as Law-maker. A Law-maker and a Judge are two distinct Offices and Relations. The King and Parliament only are Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, they are not ordinary Judges. If
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63898:70"/>God justifie as Law maker, he doth not then justifie as Judge. And if he Justifie as Judge, he doth not justifie as Law maker. 2. If God do justifie as Judge, then either all shall be alike condemned or justified; for he is Judge of all, and all be alike by nature. 3. In Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith there is Remission of Sins: but it belongeth not to a Judge as such to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sins.</p>
            <p>§. 23. <q>Faith justifieth us even at the bar of the Law of works, <hi>ratione objecti</hi> as it lays hold on Christs Satisfaction, which is our legal righteousness; it justifieth us at the bar of the Gospel, or law of Faith, <hi>formaliter, &amp; ratione sui,</hi> as it is Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-keeping, or a fulfilling of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-law. Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> p. 420.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This implyes that there are two Divine Laws, the law of Works, and the law of Faith, which cannot be while God is one. Two divine Laws will infer infinite proceeding, and so no law at all. Though the precepts of God be many, yet they are all reducible to the will of God, as manifested for the rule of our duty and obedience. The Law is holy, just, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. If you suppose another Divine Law, either it is the same with this, or contrary. If the same, then it is not another, the Law then is but one as God is one. If contrary, then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, unjust, and evil, which were to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Divine Law. Indeed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63898:71"/>makes mention of the Law of Works, and of the Law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. but how? not as two distinct Divine Laws. But the Law of Works as distinct from and opposite to the Law of Faith, is not Gods Law, but the Law of Sin, which reigns in all the graceless and unconverted, and is therefore cast out in sound conversion; and in the room of it comes the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> setting free from the Law of Sin and Death. The Law of Works as distinct from and opposite to the Law of Faith, doth not exclude boasting, but makes us to glory in our selves, and not in God, and so it is Antichristian and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The Law and Faith, the Law and the Promise, the Law and the Gospel are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strinct, and by no means to be confounded. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19, 20. the Law and the Promise of Salvation through Faith in Christ are clearly distinguished. To be justified <hi>vi legis latae,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth we are, <hi>p.</hi> 421. is not to be justified by Christ.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.21.</note> If Justification be by the Law, then Christ is in vain. Christ is not Law, nor as Christ is he a Law-giver; but he is exalted of God to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to all the Elect people of God, and forgiveness of Sins. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. The Law as opposite to Christ is Idolatry, and Antichristian, and being trusted to leads to desperation, and worketh nothing but wrath,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63898:71"/>a spirit of bondage, hypocrisie, and meer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced obedience. But the Law as a Servant to Christ, and forgiveness of sin through Faith in him, is holy, just, and good, a sweet and easie yoke to the godly, they delight in it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inward man, and make it their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation all the day. One and the same thing is Law to the graceless, and Gospel to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; the savour of death unto death to the one, and the savour of life unto life to the other. Let it be admitted <hi>de nomine</hi> that the Gospel is a Law, and that Christ is a Law-giver; the question then is, what sort of Law it is, and what kind of Law-giver Christ is? Either Christ is a Law-giver no otherwise than is <hi>Moses,</hi> or he is not. If yea,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.17.</note> then he is not Christ, and then <hi>Socinus</hi> is in the right, and our whole faith is a lie. If not, then we are justified by faith, and by faith only, simply and nakedly as it apprehendeth and layeth hold upon the infinite merit, satisfaction, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and atonement which is in Christ, and is called the Righteousness of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, partaked by Faith for all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly uses to the Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. So that the Law and the Works of the Law, and all that issueth from the law as an operative cause, are wholly excluded from having any hand at all in the Justification of a Sinner, and in the forgiveness of sin from first to last. Here the Law, and all such works as be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the law, so far as they seek to have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63898:72"/>any the least share in meriting forgiveness of Sin and Justification, or would be thought adjuvant causes to Christ, as though he were somewhat beholding to them for assistance in this matter; so far I say, they are ungodly, heretical, and Antichristian. But it is the sole merit and satisfaction of Christ, the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience of Jesus as he is very God and Man, this and no other is it which the Scripture calls the Righteousness of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law; the office of Faith is to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, embrace, rely, and rest upon this as an infinite, all sufficient, and eternal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and faith as so apprehending, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, resting and relying is it which by the Gospel is imputed to us for righteousness, and is our justification from the charge of sin in general, and from all curse and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the same. And being forgiven all sin and set free from the curse and vengeance of the Law for sin, through Faith alone, we love God, and do all such good works as he hath appointed us to walk in. So that Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is neither inherent within us as is faith, nor is it without us in the Clouds peeping forth or emerging by an imaginary resultan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no man knows how or what. But Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is by faith, and faith is divine evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the breast of him that hath it; God is he who justifieth by Conscience his agent or deputy in the breast of the regenerate Soul, through faith, according to the Gospel.

            <p>§. 27. <q>To pluck up all the desperate Antinomian consequences by the root; there needs no more than a right understanding of the true and proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manner of Christs redeeming us; it is not by way of solution, but of satisfaction.

            <p>§. 29. <q>Many make this their great strong hold. Repentance and sincere Obedience, are not recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, receiving graces, as Faith is; and so cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Justification and Righteousness. Now this falls; for, there is no act of receiving these. Justification, right to Heaven, Righteousness, cometh on men. <hi>Ib.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is granted that these divine blessings come on men: All the question is how they come on men? there are but two ways imaginable; of debt and due desert
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63898:75"/>as wages for work, <hi>quid pro quo;</hi> or of grace and free gift. If the former, then grace is subverted and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all faith, hope, and piety. If the latter, then of necessity they must be received or they cannot be had. Now being spiritual gifts they must be spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and received, or they cannot be had. But it is impossible and a contradiction to the nature of faith and spiritual gifts, that they should be spiritually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, perceived, and received by any other way than by faith, and by this only. This then remains an invincible strong hold, against which the gates of hell cannot prevail, that God of his free grace doth ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to us remission of sins, Justification, Adoption, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Christ, as a free gift, and we by faith (which is the gift of God) do apprehend and perceive the same, and penitently, humbly, thankfully, holily, and gladly receive this blessed gift, and it becomes ours for all heavenly uses to the Soul. Being thus by faith (which is its own infallible evidence in the breast of him that hath it) made partakers of the choicest blessings that a man is capable of in this world, we cannot but love God, and live unto him in the delightful Obedience of his laws. And thus Justification by faith and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be distinct, and yet undivided and inseperable, the former being the spring and fountain of all our holy love to God and sincere Obedience. <hi>A holy sin-hating God,</hi>

            <p>§. 30. <q>As condemnation cometh upon men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63898:75"/>any act of receiving it, it is a resultancy from the Law upon disobedience; so Justification, right to Heaven, is a resultancy from a Law promise (the condition being performed.) Mr. <hi>Truman, p.</hi> 259. Mr. <hi>Gibbons, p.</hi> 418 419.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A law-promise is confusion, there is no such thing in Divinity. Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cometh on men, as wages for work, of due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert for sin. The wages of sin is death; but eternal life is not the wages of obedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> but it is the gift of God through Christ, and yet given to none but such as be in a Gospel sense worthy of it. We deserve Hell for our Sins, but we do not deserve Heaven. This is freely given and freely received. But damnation is forced upon men, they may indeed be said to receive it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.41. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. but it is sore against their will. Sinners though they love Sin, yet they do not love Hell. Receiving is twofold. 1. Passive and involuntary; thus all the damned receive eternal punishment for their sins, sore against their will. 2. Active, joyful, and with all the heart; thus all the godly do by Faith, and by it only receive Pardon, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and life eternal from God in Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 31. <q>I know you may object that place, turning from darkness to light, that they may receive remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins. But one of ordinary capacity may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is a figurative expression (because in natural things, where there is giving, there is receiving.) Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> p. 259.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We read in Scripture of Gods giving his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. his Spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. Repentance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. all things pertaining to life and god

Grace and Glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. all things with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. We also read of our receiving Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2. the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. the immovable Kingdom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. Strength, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. the atonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. abundance of grace, and of the gift of Righteousness, <hi>v.</hi> 17. remission of Sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. the promise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. the love of the Truth, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.10. mercy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. every good thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Now is all this improper speaking? Is it Antinomianism and folly to make the Scripture the sole standard in points of faith? Spiritual giving and receiving is of all other the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ths is <hi>index sui &amp; obliqui</hi> to the faith of each god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man. The contrary doctrine leads to infidelity.</p>
            <p>§. 32. <q>Aninstrument is essentially an efficient; and the act of the principal and instrument are essentially one and the same act, and both proper efficients of the same effect. If one strike with a Rod, he strikes, and the Rod stirikes, though less principally, yet both truly. Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> p. 193.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> With respect to God, there is only one efficient of what is good. Of him, and through him, and to him are all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. This is a point of Faith. God maketh use of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Heavenly Kingdom, but himself is sole effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The Word preached is instrumental for the begetting and nourishing of faith, Ministers who preach it are perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally instrumental, and each godly man under God is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably instrumental in his own Conversion, Faith, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, Adoption, Forgiveness, Justification, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from first to last. But it is God alone in Jesus Christ who is the sole efficient of all heavenly good. In things
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63898:76"/>natural the instrument and efficient are social causes, both are efficients, though both be not principally efficient. But in supernatural effects, God only is efficient, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things after the counsel of his own will, which will is only one,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.11.</note> and can have no new successive acts. Look what reason is to the Soul as rational, the general Organ or Instrument by which it doth put forth rational acts; that is faith to the Soul as heavenly and regenerate, the general Organ or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument by which it doth put forth gracious and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural acts, and is laudably instrumental in its own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness and Salvation, by soveraign causation and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency from God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Yield your Members as instruments of Righteousness unto God.</hi> Now if our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be instruments of Righteousness unto God, then our faith must needs be an instrument of Righteousness. God cannot while he is himself forgive sin to that man, who is not by faith laudably active and instrumental in the penitent and thankful receiving of forgiveness from God as a free gift in Christ. If Faith be not properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in our own Pardon, Adoption, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein doth it differ from infidelity? Admit it be a condition, either we are laudably instrumental under God in performing this condition, or we are not. If yea, then in asserting it to be a condition they do not deny but rather affirm it to be a proper instrument. If not, then it is not Faith, but Infidelity, and so no condition.</p>
            <p>§. 33. <q>Every condition is only a <hi>sine qua non.</hi> Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> p. 164.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A <hi>sine qua non</hi> doth most fitly agree to God in Christ, as is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. and the nature of the thing it self. Without Christ we can do nothing; without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:63898:77"/>nothing made that was made. I grant that <hi>sine qua non</hi> agreeth to every thing that is necessary, but a thing may be necessary, and yet not be God. <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi> is the cause of causes, is no other than God in Christ. Faith is no cause of Justification, much less a <hi>causa sine qua non.</hi> But Justification being freely tendered, we cannot have it unless we receive it, and receive it we cannot save by faith. I say by faith, not as an holy work. For if forgiveness of sin be by faith as an holy work, then necessarily it will follow that where is the most holiness there shall be the most forgiveness. For <hi>a quatenus &amp; ad omne &amp; ad gradum valet consequentia.</hi> And then God himself shall be reputed a Sinner and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, because he is most holy: and next to him the man Jesus Christ, and all the holy ones in Heaven shall be the greatest sinners, and have the greatest pardon, as being next to God in holiness. It is plain that we are not justified and pardoned by Faith as an holy work, nor is any thing in us a cause of forgiveness and Justification. But pardon is freely tendered by the Gospel as a free gift in Christ, and we as needy, and lost, and undone Souls in our selves, do by Grace put forth the naked hand or instrument of Faith, and penitently and galdly accept this blessed gift, and it becomes ours.</p>
            <p>§. 34. <q>The immediate effect of Christs satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that God might be just, though he should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Sinners. Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> p. 86.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect of Christs satisfaction is reconciliation with God through faith in Christ, or the eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all the elect through faith in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. God is essentially just, holy, true, and good, but not so to those who have no Faith. Wanting Faith they make
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63898:77"/>God a liar, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. I say not that God had been just had he pardoned Sinners without ransom and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement by Christ. But by the Ransom and Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, his Justice and his Mercy are rendred most sweet and lovely to all the Elect in Christ through Faith; and the same Justice and Mercy are consuming Fire and everlasting Burnings to all the graceless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, through their own sin and folly.</p>
            <p>§. 35. <q>
                  <hi>Noxa Caput sequitur.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> p. 424.</q>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Naturally and according to legal Justice it is so; but Grace is above nature, and the Divine Justice is not legal, but infinitely above it. And therefore God may well lay all the iniquities of the elect upon Christ, and he who knew no sin was made Sin for them, that they might be made the Righteousness of God in him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p>§. 36. <q>Punishment is the <hi>genus,</hi> and the whole nature of it is in every <hi>species,</hi> in every chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Truman, p.</hi> 97.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In every Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of the Godly there is something painful and unpleasant to nature: but in no Chastisement of the godly is there everlasting Punishment. Set aside this, and all other Punishment is everlasting Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not as in it self, but as sanctified, and as it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by, and most surely endeth in everlasting Mercy.</p>
            <p>§. 37. <q>There is a twofold Condemnation, by the Law, and by the Sentence of the Judge. Mr. <hi>Truman, p.</hi> 107.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is so in Civil Judicature, but not in Divine Judicature. For in this, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under God is a Law to it self, both act and object;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> it layeth before the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his Duty, convicteth him of sin, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63898:78"/>Sentence upon him, and executeth the Sentence, by self-tormenting anguish in the Sinners bosom eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if Grace prevent not: And all this by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from God the supream Judge.</p>
            <p>§. 38. <q>There are the same terms and conditions of Justification and Salvation. Mr. <hi>Truman, p.</hi> 152.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As both are of free Grace and gift, so both are by Faith only, and not by works, lest any man should boast. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. As Justification consisteth in Remission of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, so it is by Faith only. As it is the Sentence of the supream Judge at the great day, so it will be by sight, and not by Faith: And then it is no forgiveness of Sin, but the solemn clearing and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all the Saints, who once were Sinners, but at the day of Judgment, and thenceforth for ever are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. And where is no Sin, there is no place for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness. As Salvation importeth the same with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eternal Glorification after this life, so it will be by Vision, and we have now only right to it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. But we have not now right to forgiveness of Sin, but we are actually forgiven all sin through Faith, and we are actually justified from all Sin through Faith. And this forgiveness and Justification from Sin through Faith, is now perfect and compleat, and admitteth of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, though our Faith it self and Sanctification be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. And though there be a necessity of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet is that infallibly future: And the holy fear of Apostacy is at once both a sure pledge and principal Engine of Perseverance. And so much for Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> both whose writings worthy M. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> commendeth as extraordinary clear and sound in this point of Justification: and saith, that no man more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63898:78"/>clearly opened the Doctrine of Justification than Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> in his foresaid Sermon. <hi>Christian Directory, p.</hi> 924. and <hi>Treatise of Justifying Righteousness,</hi> p. 23.</p>
            <p>I have a word or two more with reference to the late worthy Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who in his Book entituled, <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Discourses on the Glory of Christ,</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 323, to <hi>pag.</hi> 138. in my opinion runs into the contrary extream of <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> yea and <hi>Pelagianism</hi> too.</p>
            <p>§. 39. <q>There is a natural Union between Christ and his Church, such as is between man and man. Dr. <hi>Owen, ib.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If so, then Christ is no more but a meer man, and then he is not Christ, and the Church is no longer it self. Christ as man is naturally related to all men, those in Hell not excepted. For it is a contradiction to be a man, and not naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to all the race of men. But as bare man he is not Christ, but the true Christ is God and man, and as such he is supernatural, and the Church <hi>quâ talis,</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mystical and supernatural; and there is no natural Union at all between Christ and the Church, but it is wholly by Faith, and Faith is supernatural. What is natural is common to all,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3.2.</note> but all men have not Faith That Scripture <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. doth not prove a natural Union between Christ and the Church, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>§. 40. <q>There is as distinct from mystical, a soede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conjunction between Christ and the Church. Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Conjunction is where one by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all that are concerned, undertakes to be a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor or Surety for others, to do and answer what on their part is required of them for attaining the ends of the Covenant.

            <p>§. 41. <q>There is mystical Conjunction between Christ and the Church, which although it is not actually consummate without an actual participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi>Answ.</hi> This implyes, that antecedent to actual Participation of the Spirit of Christ, there is mystical Union between Christ and the Elect, though not actually consummate: but so soon as we are regenerate and actually partake of the Spirit of Christ, then mystical Union between Christ and us is actually consummate. But certainly this is not that Doctrine which is according to Godliness. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Regeneration there is no mystical Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Elect. But if we consider God as Law-giver, so the Elect themselves before and without Faith are condemned already,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.18.36.</note> and the Wrath of God abideth on them, and should they so dye they should perish eternally. Before Conversion we have no Union with Christ, but all our Union is with Satan, and with worldly and ungodly Lusts. And it is false, that so soon as we are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and actually partake of the Spirit of Christ the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Christ and us is consummate. For we are but in part sanctified, and so long as there is any sin in us, and our Sanctification is imperfect for the degree, the Union between Christ and us is not consummate. Our Pardon and Justification is indeed perfect, and our perfect Sanctification and eternal Glorification is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly future, but what is barely future is not present. Christ is the Surety of the new Covenant, but not in a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, legal, and political sense; but in a heavenly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, transcendent and mystical sense, which profiteth

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Did Christ take on his whole Soul everlasting Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Was he everlastingly hated of God? Was h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

But he did not, he could not take on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and on his whole Soul, the utmost of evil that God had ever threatned to Sin and Sinners. For then God must needs eternally hate and torment him, as he doth and will do those in Hell: and he also must needs be full of eternal hatred against God, and self-tormenting anguish and Despair. What Christ did endure did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>in specie</hi> from everlasting hellish Despair and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was neither <hi>idem</hi> nor <hi>tantundem.</hi> These two are the same, they do not differ <hi>in specie.</hi> The Death of Christ is truly a Price, and a Counter price for the Sin of the World; but not in a legal, but only in an evangelical sense, not to be understood but by Faith and the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Having thus refuted the Errours and extreams about this sweet and precious Doctrine of Justification, I shall in a few words positively declare the summ of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth the substance, marrow, and kernel of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, necessary to Salvation. As we are in the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> all men by nature be Children of Wrath, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63898:80"/>dead in sin, and there is in them the Law of Works gendring unto bondage, as opposite to the Law of Faith and the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Jesus Christ very God and man is the only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer of lost man: Nothing may be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as co-ordinate with him in this work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A false Charge is with God its own Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thus Satan himself is capable of being justified, it being a sin to belye the Devil.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Against the Charge of Sin in general and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the same, no man since the Fall can while in this World be justified save by Faith in Jesus, and by Faith only, not as opposite to but as inseparably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with, and the happy Instrument of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all holy Obedience from first to last. Being pardoned all Sin by Faith only for Christ's sake, we then love God, and do all good works. In order of nature Justification and forgiveness of Sin through Faith is first, and then Regeneration, Adoption, sincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and universal Piety, but as to time they are together.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Being acquitted from all Sin in the general, and Condemnation for the same by Faith, there is no need of further Justification in this World, nor can there be, with respect to God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Against the Charge of Ungodliness, Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Unbelief, nothing can be our Justification but Godliness, Repentance, and Faith, both before God and man.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All the Sins of the Elect be permitted by God in eternal mercy to them, yet may no man sin that Grace may abound, and the Elect before Conversion be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p n="8">8. Faith is its own evidence in the breast of him that hath it, it may consist with doubts, but not with reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and allowed doubts, ordinarily.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There is no difference between the merit and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of Christ; the whole state of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Incarnation to his Suffering, especially his dying for us, all of it is merit, and all of it is satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, atonement, and ransom on our behalf, though emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently his Death: it is meritorious ransom, and all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient merit, as it is the Piety, Humiliation, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of that same Jesus who is very God and man, which we apprehending and resting upon by Faith, as feeely wrought for us, and assured to us by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, this our Faith is imputed to us for Righteousness, all the Sin being pardoned.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In renouncing all our own doings, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Merit, that we may by Faith have perfect Remission in Christ, we do not hereby reaounce our own renouncing.</p>
